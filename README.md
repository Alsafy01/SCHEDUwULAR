# Priority Queues of CPU Scheduling Algorithms 
- It's not much but the essential aspects of CPU scheduling algorithms have been taken care of, and try to ensure that they are accurately represented in the simulation on the website. There's more that can be done in the future and the project has the potential to become an open-source resource for future updates and modifications from the community.
